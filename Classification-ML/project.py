# Ensemble Modeling Plan

## 1. Data Preprocessing
- Apply **one-hot encoding** for categorical features.
- Apply **feature scaling** (e.g., StandardScaler) especially for distance-based models like KNN, SVM, Logistic Regression.

## 2. Define Base Models
- Include diverse models such as:
  - Logistic Regression (with scaling)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (with scaling)
  - Support Vector Machine (with scaling)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest

## 3. Model Combination Strategy
- Skip bagging for now to keep things simpler and faster.
- Create random combinations of 2 to 4 models from the base models pool.
- For each combination:
  - Build a StackingClassifier with the chosen models as base estimators.
  - Use Logistic Regression as the meta-classifier.

## 4. Training and Evaluation
- Use a train-test split (e.g., 80% train, 20% test).
- Train each stacking model on the training data.
- Evaluate performance on the test data using metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Recall
  - F1 Score (recommended, especially for imbalanced data)
- Keep track of the best performing model combination based on the chosen metric.

## 5. Iteration and Selection
- Repeat the random combination and evaluation process multiple times (e.g., 10 iterations).
- Select the combination with the highest performance score.

## 6. Optional Enhancements
- Use cross-validation (e.g., StratifiedKFold) instead of simple train-test split for more robust evaluation.
- Experiment with VotingClassifier to compare performance with stacking.
- Tune the meta-classifier hyperparameters via GridSearchCV or similar tools.
- Add more base models or ensemble methods as needed.

## Summary
- One-hot encode + scale data.
- Define diverse base models.
- Randomly pick model combos and build stacking classifiers.
- Train, evaluate, and track performance.
- Pick the best model combo after several trials.
